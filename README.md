# NTWRKD

NTWRKD is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform enabling secure, efficient, and verifiable AI agent orchestration through smart contract-based prompt engineering.

- Prompts become self-executing, verifiable blockchain assets
- Agent coordination happens through trustless protocols
- Quality is assured through token economics
- Memory and context are preserved on-chain
- Cross-provider execution is standardized
